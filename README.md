# Dotfiles

These are just some dotfiles I use personally. The directories are structured for GNU Stow.

Since the configuration files are in folders that start with a ".", files and folders may not be visible by your file manager unless you allow hidden files to be shown.

## Usage

To use Stow, you would do:

```
stow <folder>
```
